# Embedded Preview Box - Quick Summary

## What Changed?
The PIP preview is now **embedded directly in the preview box** instead of opening in a separate floating window.

## Before (Build 15):
- Separate floating Electron window
- Could be moved and resized
- More complex window management

## After (Build 16):
- Content embedded in iframe
- Fixed inside preview box
- Simpler and cleaner

## Benefits:
✅ **Simpler** - No separate window management  
✅ **Faster** - No window creation delay  
✅ **Cleaner** - Always in the preview box  
✅ **Better DRM** - Same security as main window  
✅ **Lower Memory** - One window instead of two  

## How It Works:
1. Click a service (e.g., Netflix)
2. Content loads **directly in the preview box**
3. Iframe displays the service
4. Click "Full Screen" to open in separate window
5. Click "Close" to clear preview

## User Experience:
- **Electron Mode**: Embedded iframe in preview box
- **Browser Mode**: Still opens in new tabs (unchanged)

## Technical:
- Uses iframe instead of separate BrowserWindow
- No IPC communication needed
- Simpler code, easier to maintain
- All DRM features work correctly

## Build:
- **Build Number**: 16
- **Status**: Complete and tested
