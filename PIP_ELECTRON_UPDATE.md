# PIP Functionality Update for Electron Environment

## Overview
Updated the Picture-in-Picture (PIP) functionality to work properly in the Electron environment, removing old HTML/browser-based code and implementing proper Electron IPC communication.

## Changes Made

### 1. **preload.js** - Exposed PIP Functions via Context Bridge
- Added `createPiPWindow()` - Creates a new PIP window with specified bounds
- Added `closePiPWindow()` - Closes the current PIP window
- Added `expandPiPWindow()` - Expands PIP window to full screen
- Added `repositionPiPWindow()` - Repositions PIP window to new bounds
- Added event listeners:
  - `onPiPWindowClosed()` - Fires when PIP window is closed
  - `onPiPWindowMoved()` - Fires when PIP window is moved
  - `onPiPWindowResized()` - Fires when PIP window is resized
- Added `removePiPWindowListeners()` - Cleanup function for event listeners

### 2. **dashboard/index.html** - Updated PIP Implementation

#### Removed Old Code:
- ❌ OpenPiP integration code (browser extension approach)
- ❌ Native PiP API attempts (`tryNativePiP()` function)
- ❌ Browser `window.open()` for popup windows
- ❌ Inline iframe fallback code
- ❌ `getEmbeddableUrl()` function
- ❌ `openPiPExtTab()` function
- ❌ PIP extension-related buttons

#### Updated Functions:
- ✅ `showPiPPreview()` - Now uses Electron IPC to create PIP windows
- ✅ `closePiP()` - Now uses Electron IPC to close PIP windows
- ✅ `expandPiP()` - Now uses Electron IPC to expand to full screen
- ✅ `repositionPiP()` - Now uses Electron IPC to reposition windows

#### Added Features:
- ✅ PIP window event listeners on page load
- ✅ Automatic UI reset when PIP window is closed
- ✅ Proper error handling for all IPC calls
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

### 3. **main.js** - Already Had Proper Implementation
The main process already had all the necessary IPC handlers:
- `create-pip-window` - Creates BrowserWindow for PIP
- `close-pip-window` - Closes PIP window
- `expand-pip-window` - Expands to full screen
- `reposition-pip-window` - Repositions window
- Event emitters for window close/move/resize

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. User clicks on a service (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)
2. Service preview opens in a positioned PIP window via Electron
3. User can:
   - Click again to expand to full screen
   - Click "Reposition" to move window to new location
   - Close the PIP window

### Technical Flow:
1. **Render Process** (index.html):
   - User action triggers `showPiPPreview()`
   - Calculates viewport bounds
   - Calls `window.electronAPI.createPiPWindow(url, serviceName, bounds)`

2. **Context Bridge** (preload.js):
   - Exposes safe IPC methods to renderer
   - Forwards calls to main process

3. **Main Process** (main.js):
   - Receives IPC call via `ipcMain.handle()`
   - Creates new BrowserWindow with specified bounds
   - Loads URL in the window
   - Sends events back to renderer (closed, moved, resized)

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Native Electron Windows**: Uses proper BrowserWindow instances instead of browser popups
2. **Better Control**: Full control over window properties (size, position, frame, etc.)
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **No Popup Blockers**: No browser popup blocker issues
5. **Better Performance**: Native windows are more efficient than browser popups
6. **Cleaner Code**: Removed ~150 lines of browser-specific workarounds

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click on a service to open PIP preview
- [ ] Verify PIP window opens in correct position
- [ ] Click "Full Screen" to expand
- [ ] Click "Reposition" to move window
- [ ] Close PIP window via close button
- [ ] Verify UI resets properly after closing
- [ ] Test with multiple services
- [ ] Test window resize behavior

## Notes

- The PIP window is created as a child window of the main window
- Window has frame enabled for user control
- Window is not always on top (can be changed in main.js if needed)
- Window appears in taskbar (can be hidden with `skipTaskbar: true`)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Add window drag and drop support
- Add window transparency options
- Add keyboard shortcuts for PIP controls
- Add PIP window presets (sizes/positions)
- Add PIP window snapping to edges
- Add multi-PIP support (multiple previews)
