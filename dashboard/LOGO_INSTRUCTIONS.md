## üíæ Installation Steps

### 1. Generate the Logo
- Use one of the AI tools above with the provided prompt
- Download as PNG with transparent background
- Recommended size: 512x512px minimum

### 2. Save the Logo
Place the generated logo file in the dashboard directory:

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Copy your generated logo to:
C:\Users\chris\@TVBOX\mediabox-dev\dashboard\logo.png
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Copy your generated logo to:
cp /path/to/your/downloaded/logo.png ./dashboard/logo.png
```

### 3. Verify Installation
The logo should automatically appear in the dashboard header. If you're running in Docker:

```bash
# Rebuild if needed (logo is mounted as volume, so should appear immediately)
docker-compose restart

# Or just refresh your browser
```

### 4. Alternative: Use Base64 (No File Needed)
If you prefer embedding the logo directly in HTML:

1. Convert your PNG to base64: https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image
2. Edit `dashboard/index.html`
3. Replace `<img src="logo.png"` with:
   ```html
   <img src="data:image/png;base64,YOUR_BASE64_STRING_HERE"
   ```

## üé® Logo Design Guidelines

Your logo should:
- ‚úÖ Work well at 60px height (header size)
- ‚úÖ Be clearly visible on dark/glassmorphic backgrounds
- ‚úÖ Have transparent background (no white box)
- ‚úÖ Use colors that complement the blue gradient theme
- ‚úÖ Be recognizable even when small
- ‚úÖ Convey "AI", "Media", and "Smart Home" concepts

Avoid:
- ‚ùå Too many fine details that disappear when small
- ‚ùå Text in the logo (name is already in header)
- ‚ùå Overly complex designs
- ‚ùå Colors that clash with blue theme

## üîß Customization Options

### Change Logo Size
Edit `dashboard/index.html`, find:
```css
.logo {
  height: 60px;  /* Change this value */
  width: auto;
}
```

### Add Logo Animation
Add this to the CSS:
```css
.logo {
  animation: logoGlow 3s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes logoGlow {
  0%, 100% {
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 5px rgba(79, 172, 254, 0.3));
  }
  50% {
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 15px rgba(79, 172, 254, 0.8));
  }
}
```

## üéØ Quick Example

Here's what I've updated in the dashboard:
- Added logo container with proper styling
- Logo appears next to "MediaBox AI" title
- Glassmorphic gradient applied to text
- Responsive design for mobile
- Fallback: logo hides if file not found

The dashboard is ready - just add your `logo.png` file!

## üìù Tips for Best Results

1. **Generate Multiple Variations**: Create 3-4 options and pick the best
2. **Test at Small Size**: Ensure logo is clear when scaled down
3. **Match the Theme**: Blue/cyan colors work best with existing design
4. **Keep it Simple**: Icon should be recognizable instantly
5. **Use Transparency**: PNG with alpha channel for clean look

Just generate your logo and save it as `dashboard/logo.png` and it will appear automatically!
